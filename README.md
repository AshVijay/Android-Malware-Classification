# Android-Malware-Classification
A program written using Pytorch to learn sequential information from model complex flows extracted from various malware repositories to classify an application as malicious and benign. 

The concept of complex flows (introduced in the paper â€˜Android Malware Detection using Complex-Flows') is used as the features for training an RNN with the LSTM architecture to model and classify the sequences of flows.
